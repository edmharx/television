# TELEVISION

This Object Oriented Program shows the attributes and methods of a working TV.

The keyboard module is imported not only to showcase the different methods of the TV in one run of the code, but the keyboard also acted as the remote control of the two TV's.

The **name** attribute are used to let the user differentiate which hotkey that serves as "Remote Control" per TV are being used.
